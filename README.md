# CS-350-Emerging-Sys-Arch-Tech
This is my repsoitory for my projects throughout my course in emerging systems architecture and technologies focusing on embedded systems.

In this repository I have uploaded documents from 2 projects: 
The Milestone Two (controlling LED with user input) and Milestone Three (Morse Code) assignments from the CS-350 course.


Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. 
            In these project I implemented functionality for the TI CC3220x LAUNCHXL board to cycle its LED lights on and off based on user input and
            implemented functionality to flash the lights in a pattern to display alternating messages of "SOS" and "OK" in morse code. 


    What did you do particularly well? 
            I feel that I did a particularly good job in keeping the code for this project as modular as possible.
            In embedded systems, hardware is generally made to serve one (or few) specific functions reliably and are not designed to be repurposed
            to any great extent, but keeping code clean and readable is still very important. 


    Where could you improve? 
            In completing this project I was encountering an error code 615 which I was never able to solve in both milestones.
            This error implies a connectivity issue to the board, however the board was receiving power from the computer and the cable/port it was
            utilizing were both fully functional. I could have improved this project by effectively solving this error.


    What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
            I am adding the resource of the code composer studio IDE from TI to my support network in this project.


    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
            My kills in debugging were definitely improved throughout these projects and the ones that followed after in this course.
            I was able to solve many more errors in my code without seeking outside assistance than in previous projects.
            I also learned a significant amount about setting up UART peripherals for input/output systems. 
            In addition to debugging I also leaned a significant amount about embedded systems and computer peripherals that will surely be helpful in
            the future.


    How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
            I made this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable by keeping the code very modular.
            Although embedded systems are typically not repurposed, that does not mean that the code written for them will not be repurposed for other
            applications so keeping code adaptable, readable, and maintainable remains an important aspect of development.
